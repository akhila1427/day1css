HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.

HTML Documents<br>
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between body and body.</pre>
<h3> Declaration</h3>
  <pre>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
  
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
  
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
  
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:!DOCTYPE html</pre>
